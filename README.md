# Primo Local Customizations

## Braille and Large Print
The MARC record contains a field in the 008 that indicates the form of the item. Primo does not use this data by default, making it difficult for users to discover materials in Braille or Large print. The pdf Local_resource_type_Large_Print_and_Braille.pdf contains instructions for adding this form type to the item record and the search facets.
